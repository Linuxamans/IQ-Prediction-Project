# IQ-Prediction-Project

    The project's primary objective is to determine the Intelligent Quotient (IQ) of a
    person using face features.This system is useful to predict the IQ of a person by inputting
    his/her image to a well-trained model by a considerable dataset.First we conducted an IQ
    test to a group of people,then we captured the faces of those people and labelled them
    according to their IQ range.In this process we trained our model.As per our research, no
    existing models have the features to predict the IQ using face features.
